User checklist:

For each object, make sure to carefully inspect all available information:
    - 1D spectrum (matplotlib window)
    - 2D stamps (top row in ds9)
    - direct images (middle row in ds9)
    
While working on an object, consider the following guidelines:

- Look at the direct images. Is the source a real galaxy?
    Make sure it is not a star or spurious source detected along a 
    diffraction spike, hot/bad pixel or other artifact.

- Is the line real? Make sure it is not:
    - a bright (major, red band) zeroth order 
    - off-center from the trace (WCS in 2D stamp significantly off from zero)
    - a hot/bad pixel, cosmic ray, diffraction spike, or other artifact

- Make sure the emission line shape in 2D stamp is consistent with 
  the source's shape

- Does the wavelength of the emission line in the 1D spectrum matches 
  the wavelength in the 2D stamp? Or does it match a source of contamination?

- If there is only one line, assume it is Halpha unless you see asymmetry 
  indicating Hbeta/[OIII].

- Check for contamination. Likely sources of contamination are:
    - 

- If there are multiple emission lines, the wavelengths should match. 
    If you cannot find a redshift that accounts for all lines, could 
    the lines be from a different source?

- Line ratio sanity check:
    - Ha should be stronger than [SII]
    - [OIII] should almost always be stronger than Hbeta

- Is the line fit properly in the 1D spectrum (red curve)? If not, consider:
    - changing the nodes to get a better continuum fit;
    - masking out highly contaminated regions of the spectrum;
    - changing the blue (red) cutoff wavelength of G102 (G141);
    - changing the transition wavelength between the grisms 
        (especially useful if an emission line is right on the edge)
 
- If the 'current' emission line (red circle) is not believable, you can 
  try the 'n' option to move to the next strongest emission line identified 
  in the spectrum.

Matplotlib Window

TOP ROW - The following describes the elements plotted in the top row. 
    - Black curve (step function): object's spectrum
    - Blue dashed curve: continuum model
    - Red curve: full model (continuum + Gaussian emission lines)
    - Blue vertical lines: expected location of emission lines given the 
      current redshift guess for the object. Lines are labeled and the S/N 
      of the emission line fit is printed in parentheses. The current list of 
      lines is [OII]3727, Hgamma, Heta, [OIII]4959, [OIII]5007, Halpha, 
      [SII]6716,6730, [SIII]9069, [SIII]9532, HeI.
    - Blue circles: locations of all emission line candidates detected 
      for this object
    - Red circle: the 'current' emission line candidate that you will use to 
      set the redshift for the object. If multiple lines are detected, the one
      with the strongest preliminary S/N is chosen and assumed to be HÎ±.
    - Black circles - spline nodes used to fit the continuum.
Cyan dotted vertical line - the transition wavelength between the two grisms.
Red vertical shaded bands (not present in this example) - the locations in wavelength space of 0th order contaminants. These bands indicate 0th orders that overlap the object's spectral trace and belong to bright objects (magnitude < 23.5). These portions of the spectrum are masked and not considered in the fitting.
Orange vertical shaded bands (not present in this example) - the locations in wavelength space of possible 0th order contaminants. These bands indicate 0th orders that overlap the object's spectral trace but belong to fainter objects (magnitude > 23.5).
Grey vertical shaded bands (not present in this example) - any regions of the spectrum you have masked out (see Interactive Fitter).
BOTTOM ROW - We focus mainly on the top row, but the bottom plot is useful to see the S/N of emission line candidates relative to the threshold (red horizontal line).
